== Name

cryptsetup-luksKillSlot - wipe a key-slot from the LUKS device

== SYNOPSIS

*cryptsetup _luksKillSlot_ [<options>] <device> <key slot number>*

== DESCRIPTION

Wipe the key-slot number <key slot> from the LUKS device.
Except running in batch-mode (-q) a remaining passphrase must be supplied, either interactively or via --key-file.
This command can remove the last remaining key-slot, but requires an interactive confirmation when doing so.
Removing the last passphrase makes a LUKS container permanently inaccessible.

*<options>* can be [--key-file, --keyfile-offset, --keyfile-size, --header, --disable-locks, --type, --verify-passphrase, --timeout].

*WARNING:* If you read the passphrase from stdin (without further argument or with '-' as an argument to --key-file), batch-mode (-q) will be implicitly switched on and no warning will be given when you remove the last remaining passphrase from a LUKS container.
Removing the last passphrase makes the LUKS container permanently inaccessible.

*NOTE:* If there is no passphrase provided (on stdin or through --key-file argument) and batch-mode (-q) is active, the key-slot is removed without any other warning.
