== Name

cryptsetup-resize - resize an active mapping

== SYNOPSIS

*cryptsetup _resize_ [<options>] <name>*

== DESCRIPTION

Resizes an active mapping <name>.

If --size (in 512-bytes sectors) or --device-size are not specified, the
size is computed from the underlying device. For LUKS it is the size of
the underlying device without the area reserved for LUKS header (see
data payload offset in *luksDump* command). For plain crypt device, the
whole device size is used.

Note that this does not change the raw device geometry, it just changes
how many sectors of the raw device are represented in the mapped device.

If cryptsetup detected volume key for active device loaded in kernel
keyring service, resize action would first try to retrieve the key using
a token. Only if it failed, it'd ask for a passphrase to unlock a
keyslot (LUKS) or to derive a volume key again (plain mode). The kernel
keyring is used by default for LUKS2 devices.

*<options>* can be [--size, --device-size, --token-id, --token-only,
--token-type, --key-slot, --key-file, --keyfile-size, --keyfile-offset,
--timeout, --disable-external-tokens, --disable-locks, --disable-keyring,
--volume-key-keyring, --verify-passphrase, --timeout, --external-tokens-path].
