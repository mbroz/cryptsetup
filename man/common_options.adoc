== OPTIONS

ifdef::ACTION_LUKSFORMAT,ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*--align-payload <number of 512 byte sectors>*::
Align payload at a boundary of _value_ 512-byte sectors.
+
If not specified, cryptsetup tries to use the topology info provided by
the kernel for the underlying device to get the optimal alignment. If
not available (or the calculated value is a multiple of the default)
data is by default aligned to a 1MiB boundary (i.e. 2048 512-byte
sectors).
+
For a detached LUKS header, this option specifies the offset on the data
device. See also the --header option.
+
*WARNING:* This option is DEPRECATED and has often unexpected impact to
the data offset and keyslot area size (for LUKS2) due to the complex
rounding. For fixed data device offset use _--offset_ option instead.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_OPEN,ACTION_REFRESH[]
*--allow-discards*::
Allow the use of discard (TRIM) requests for the device. This is also not
supported for LUKS2 devices with data integrity protection.
+
*WARNING:* This command can have a negative security impact because it
can make filesystem-level operations visible on the physical device. For
example, information leaking filesystem type, used space, etc. may be
extractable from the physical device if the discarded blocks can be
located later. If in doubt, do not use it.
+
A kernel version of 3.1 or later is needed. For earlier kernels, this
option is ignored.
endif::[]

ifdef::COMMON_OPTIONS[]
*--batch-mode, -q*::
Suppresses all confirmation questions. Use with care!
+
If the --verify-passphrase option is not specified, this option also
switches off the passphrase verification.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*--block-size* _value_ *(LUKS1 only)*::
Use re-encryption block size of _value_ in MiB.
+
Values can be between 1 and 64 MiB.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_CLOSE[]
*--cancel-deferred*::
Removes a previously configured deferred device removal in _close_
command.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_OPEN,ACTION_LUKSFORMAT,ACTION_REENCRYPT,ACTION_TCRYPTDUMP,ACTION_BENCHMARK[]
*--cipher, -c* _<cipher-spec>_::
ifdef::ACTION_OPEN,ACTION_TCRYPTDUMP[]
Set the cipher specification string for _plain_ device type.

endif::[]
ifndef::ACTION_REENCRYPT,ACTION_OPEN,ACTION_TCRYPTDUMP[]
Set the cipher specification string.
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*LUKS2*:
Set the cipher specification string for data segment only.
+
*LUKS1*:
Set the cipher specification string for data segment and keyslots.
+
*NOTE*: In encrypt mode, if cipher specification is omitted the default cipher is applied.
In reencrypt mode, if no new cipher specification is requested, the existing cipher will remain
in use. Unless the existing cipher was "cipher_null". In that case default cipher would
be applied as in encrypt mode.
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_OPEN,ACTION_LUKSFORMAT,ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
+
_cryptsetup --help_ shows the compiled-in defaults.
+
If a hash is part of the cipher specification, then it is used as part
of the IV generation. For example, ESSIV needs a hash function, while
"plain64" does not and hence none is specified.
+
For XTS mode you can optionally set a key size of 512 bits with the -s
option. Key size for XTS mode is twice that for other modes for the same
security level.
endif::[]
endif::[]

ifdef::COMMON_OPTIONS[]
*--debug or --debug-json*::
Run in debug mode with full diagnostic logs. Debug output lines are
always prefixed by *#*.
+
If --debug-json is used, additional LUKS2 JSON data structures are printed.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*--decrypt*::
Initialize (and run) device decryption mode.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_CLOSE[]
*--deferred*::
Defers device removal in _close_ command until the last user closes
it.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_OPEN,ACTION_REENCRYPT,ACTION_RESIZE[]
*--device-size* _size[units]_::
ifndef::ACTION_RESIZE[]
Instead of real device size, use specified value.
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_RESIZE[]
Sets new size of the device. If unset real device size is used.
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_OPEN[]
Usable only with _plain_ device type.
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
It means that only specified area (from the start of the device
to the specified size) will be reencrypted.
+
*WARNING:* This is destructive operation. Data beyond --device-size limit may
be lost after operation gets finished.
endif::[]
+
If no unit suffix is specified, the size is in bytes.
+
Unit suffix can be S for 512 byte sectors, K/M/G/T (or KiB,MiB,GiB,TiB)
for units with 1024 base or KB/MB/GB/TB for 1000 base (SI scale).
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_LUKSFORMAT,ACTION_REENCRYPT[]

endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_OPEN,ACTION_RESIZE,ACTION_REFRESH,ACTION_LUKSFORMAT,ACTION_LUKSRESUME,ACTION_TOKEN,ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*--disable-keyring*::
Do not load volume key in kernel keyring and store it directly in the
dm-crypt target instead. This option is supported only for the LUKS2 type.
endif::[]

ifndef::ACTION_BENCHMARK,ACTION_BITLKDUMP,ACTION_TCRYPTDUMP[]
*--disable-locks*::
Disable lock protection for metadata on disk. This option is valid
only for LUKS2 and ignored for other formats.
+
ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*NOTE:* With locking disabled LUKS2 images in files can be fully (re)encrypted
offline without need for super user privileges provided used block ciphers are
available in crypto backend.
+
endif::[]
*WARNING:* Do not use this option unless you run cryptsetup in a
restricted environment where locking is impossible to perform (where
/run directory cannot be used).
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_OPEN,ACTION_TCRYPTDUMP[]
*--disable-veracrypt*::
This option can be used to disable VeraCrypt compatible mode (only
TrueCrypt devices are recognized). Only for TCRYPT extension. See
_TCRYPT_ section in *cryptsetup*(8) for more info.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_LUKSDUMP[]
*--dump-json-metadata*::
For _luksDump_ (LUKS2 only) this option prints content of LUKS2 header
JSON metadata area.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_LUKSDUMP,ACTION_TCRYPTDUMP,ACTION_BITLKDUMP[]
*--dump-volume-key, --dump-master-key (OBSOLETE alias)*::
Print the volume key in the displayed information. Use with care,
as the volume key can be used to bypass
the passphrases, see also option --volume-key-file.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*--encrypt, --new, -N*::
Initialize (and run) device in-place encryption mode.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_RESIZE,ACTION_OPEN,ACTION_LUKSADDKEY,ACTION_LUKSDUMP,ACTION_LUKSRESUME,ACTION_TOKEN[]
*--external-tokens-path* _absolute_path_::
Override system directory path where cryptsetup searches for external token
handlers (or token plugins). It must be absolute path (starting with '/' character).
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*--force-no-keyslots (LUKS2 only)*::
Enforce initialization of reencryption operation with additional --volume-key-file,
--new-volume-key-file, --volume-key-keyring or --new-volume-key-keyring parameters
that would result in deletion of all remaining LUKS2 keyslots containing volume key.
+
*NOTE:* LUKS2 keyslot with new volume key may be added after the reencryption
operation is finished. See *cryptsetup-luksAddKey*(8) command.
+
*WARNING:* Use with extreme caution! If you loose volume key stored in a file or
in a kernel keyring before adding LUKS2 keyslot containing new volume key
the device will become unusable and all data will be lost.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*--force-offline-reencrypt (LUKS2 only)*::
Bypass active device auto-detection and enforce offline reencryption.
+
This option is useful especially for reencryption of LUKS2 images put in
files (auto-detection is not reliable in this scenario).
+
It may also help in case active device auto-detection on particular
data device does not work or report errors.
+
*WARNING:* Use with extreme caution! This may destroy data if the device
is activated and/or actively used.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_LUKSFORMAT,ACTION_LUKSADDKEY,ACTION_LUKSCHANGEKEY,ACTION_LUKSCONVERTKEY,ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*--force-password*::
Do not use password quality checking for new LUKS passwords.
+
This option is ignored if cryptsetup is built without password
quality checking support.
+
For more info about password quality check, see the manual page for
*pwquality.conf(5)* and *passwdqc.conf(5)*.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_OPEN,ACTION_LUKSFORMAT,ACTION_LUKSADDKEY,ACTION_LUKSCHANGEKEY,ACTION_LUKSCONVERTKEY,ACTION_TCRYPTDUMP,ACTION_BENCHMARK,ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*--hash, -h* _<hash-spec>_::
ifdef::ACTION_OPEN,ACTION_TCRYPTDUMP[]
Specifies the passphrase hash. Applies to _plain_ and _loopaes_ device types only.
+
For _tcrypt_ device type, it restricts checked PBKDF2 variants when looking for header.
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_LUKSFORMAT[]
Specifies the hash used in the LUKS key setup scheme and volume key
digest.
endif::[]
ifndef::ACTION_REENCRYPT,ACTION_OPEN,ACTION_TCRYPTDUMP[]
The specified hash is used for PBKDF2 and AF splitter.
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*LUKS1:*
Specifies the hash used in the LUKS1 key setup scheme and volume key digest.
+
*NOTE*: if this parameter is not specified, default hash algorithm is always used
for new LUKS1 device header.
+
*LUKS2:* Ignored unless new keyslot pbkdf algorithm is set to PBKDF2 (see --pbkdf).
endif::[]
+
ifdef::ACTION_LUKSFORMAT[]
The hash algorithm must provide at least 160 bits of output.
Do not use a non-crypto hash like *xxhash* as this breaks security.
Use _cryptsetup --help_ to show the defaults.
endif::[]
endif::[]

ifndef::ACTION_BENCHMARK,ACTION_BITLKDUMP[]
*--header <device or file storing the LUKS header>*::
ifndef::ACTION_OPEN,ACTION_ERASE[]
Use a detached (separated) metadata device or file where the LUKS
header is stored. This option allows one to store ciphertext and LUKS
header on different devices.
+
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_OPEN[]
Specify detached (separated) metadata device or file where the header is stored.
+
*WARNING:* There is no check whether the ciphertext device specified
actually belongs to the header given. In fact, you can specify an
arbitrary device as the ciphertext device with the --header option.
Use with care.
endif::[]
ifndef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
ifdef::ACTION_LUKSFORMAT[]
With a file name as the argument to --header, the file
will be automatically created if it does not exist. See the cryptsetup
FAQ for header size calculation.
+
The --align-payload option is taken as absolute sector alignment on ciphertext
device and can be zero.
endif::[]
ifndef::ACTION_LUKSFORMAT,ACTION_OPEN,ACTION_ERASE[]
For commands that change the LUKS header (e.g. _luksAddKey_),
specify the device or file with the LUKS header directly as the LUKS
device.
endif::[]
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
If used with --encrypt/--new option, the header file will be created (or overwritten).
Use with care.
+
*LUKS2*:
For decryption mode the option may be used to export original LUKS2 header
to a detached file. The passed future file must not exist at the time
of initializing the decryption operation. This frees space in head of data
device so that data can be moved at original LUKS2 header location. Later on
decryption operation continues as if the ordinary detached header was passed.
+
*WARNING:* Never put exported header file in a filesystem on top of device
you are about to decrypt! It would cause a deadlock.
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_ERASE[]
Use to specify detached LUKS2 header when erasing HW OPAL enabled data device.
endif::[]
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_LUKSHEADERBACKUP,ACTION_LUKSHEADERRESTORE[]
*--header-backup-file <file>*::
Specify file with header backup file.
endif::[]

ifdef::COMMON_OPTIONS[]
*--help, -?*::
Show help text and default parameters.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*--hotzone-size* _size_ *(LUKS2 only)*::
This option can be used to set an upper limit on the size of
reencryption area (hotzone). The _size_ can be specified with unit
suffix (for example 50M). Note that actual hotzone size may be less
than specified <size> due to other limitations (free space in keyslots
area or available memory).
+
With decryption mode for devices with LUKS2 header placed in head of data
device, the option specifies how large is the first data segment moved
from original data offset pointer.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_LUKSFORMAT[]
*--hw-opal*::
Format LUKS2 device with dm-crypt encryption stacked on top HW based encryption configured
on SED OPAL locking range. This option enables both SW and HW based data encryption.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_ERASE[]
*--hw-opal-factory-reset*::
Erase *ALL* data on the OPAL self-encrypted device, regardless of the partition it is ran on, if any,
and does not require a valid LUKS2 header to be present on the device to run. After providing
correct PSID via interactive prompt or via *--key-file* parameter the device is erased.
+
PSID is usually printed on the OPAL device label (either directly or as a QR code). PSID must be
entered without any dashes, spaces or underscores.
+
*NOTE*: PSID should be treated as sensitive information as it allows anyone with remote access to
the OPAL device to destroy data even if the device is locked. Be sure you do not leak PSID through
transparent packaging during transport or images of the drive posted online.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_LUKSFORMAT[]
*--hw-opal-only*::
Format LUKS2 device with HW based encryption configured on SED OPAL locking range only. LUKS2
format only manages locking range unlock key. This option enables HW based data encryption managed
by SED OPAL drive only.
+
*NOTE*: Please note that with OPAL-only (--hw-opal-only) encryption,
the configured OPAL administrator PIN (passphrase) allows unlocking
all configured locking ranges without LUKS keyslot decryption
(without knowledge of LUKS passphrase).
Because of many observed problems with compatibility, cryptsetup
currently DOES NOT use OPAL single-user mode, which would allow such
decoupling of OPAL admin PIN access.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*--init-only (LUKS2 only)*::
Initialize reencryption (any mode) operation in LUKS2 metadata only
and exit. If any reencrypt operation is already initialized in
metadata, the command with --init-only parameter fails.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_LUKSFORMAT[]
*--integrity <integrity algorithm>*::
Specify integrity algorithm to be used for authenticated disk
encryption in LUKS2.
+
*WARNING: This extension is EXPERIMENTAL* and requires dm-integrity
kernel target (available since kernel version 4.12). For native AEAD
modes, also enable "User-space interface for AEAD cipher algorithms" in
"Cryptographic API" section (CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API_AEAD .config
option).
+
For more info, see _AUTHENTICATED DISK ENCRYPTION_ section in *cryptsetup*(8).
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_LUKSFORMAT[]
*--integrity-inline*::
Store integrity tags to hardware sector integrity fields.
The device must support sectors with additional protection information
(PI, also known as DIF - data integrity field) of the requested size.
Another storage subsystem must not use the additional field
(the device must present a "nop" profile in the kernel).
Note that some devices must be reformatted at a low level to support
this option; for NVMe devices, see nvme(1) id-ns LBA profiles.
+
No journal or bitmap is used in this mode. The device should operate
with native speed (without any overhead).
This option is available since the Linux kernel version 6.11.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_LUKSFORMAT[]
*--integrity-key-size BYTES*::
The size of the data integrity key. Configurable only for HMAC integrity.
Default integrity key size is set to the same as hash output length.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_LUKSFORMAT[]
*--integrity-legacy-padding*::
Use inefficient legacy padding.
+
*WARNING*: Do not use this option until you need compatibility with specific
old kernel.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_REFRESH[]
*--integrity-no-journal*::
Activate device with integrity protection without using data journal
(direct write of data and integrity tags). Note that without journal
power fail can cause non-atomic write and data corruption. Use only if
journalling is performed on a different storage layer.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_LUKSFORMAT[]
*--integrity-no-wipe*::
Skip wiping of device authentication (integrity) tags. If you skip
this step, sectors will report invalid integrity tag until an
application write to the sector.
+
*NOTE:* Even some writes to the device can fail if the write is not
aligned to page size and page-cache initiates read of a sector with
invalid integrity tag.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_LUKSFORMAT,ACTION_LUKSADDKEY,ACTION_LUKSCHANGEKEY,ACTION_LUKSCONVERTKEY,ACTION_REENCRYPT,ACTION_BENCHMARK[]
*--iter-time, -i <number of milliseconds>*::
ifndef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
The number of milliseconds to spend with PBKDF passphrase processing.
Specifying 0 as parameter selects the compiled-in default.
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
The number of milliseconds to spend with PBKDF passphrase processing for the
new LUKS header.
endif::[]
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_OPEN[]
*--iv-large-sectors*::
Count Initialization Vector (IV) in larger sector size (if set)
instead of 512 bytes sectors. This option can be used only with _plain_
device type.
+
*NOTE:* This option does not have any performance or security impact,
use it only for accessing incompatible existing disk images from other
systems that require this option.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_TOKEN[]
*--json-file*::
Read token JSON from a file or write token to it. --json-file=- reads JSON from
standard input or writes it to standard output respectively.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*--keep-key*::
*LUKS2*:
Do not change effective volume key and change other parameters provided
it is requested.
+
*LUKS1*:
Reencrypt only the LUKS1 header and keyslots. Skips data in-place reencryption.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_OPEN,ACTION_LUKSFORMAT,ACTION_LUKSDUMP,ACTION_RESIZE,ACTION_LUKSRESUME,ACTION_LUKSADDKEY,ACTION_TOKEN[]
*--key-description <text>*::
Set key description in keyring that will be used for passphrase retrieval.

*--key-file, -d* _name_::
Read the passphrase from file.
+
If the name given is "-", then the passphrase will be read from stdin.
In this case, reading will not stop at newline characters.
+
ifdef::ACTION_LUKSADDKEY,ACTION_LUKSCHANGEKEY[]
The passphrase supplied via --key-file is always the passphrase for existing
keyslot requested by the command.
+
ifdef::ACTION_LUKSADDKEY[]
If you want to set a new passphrase via key file, you have to use a
positional argument or parameter --new-keyfile.
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_LUKSCHANGEKEY[]
If you want to set a new passphrase via key file, you have to use a
positional argument.
endif::[]
+
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_OPEN[]
*NOTE:* With _plain_ device type, the passphrase obtained via --key-file option is
passed directly in dm-crypt. Unlike the interactive mode (stdin)
where digest (--hash option) of the passphrase is passed in dm-crypt instead.
+
endif::[]
ifndef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
See section _NOTES ON PASSPHRASE PROCESSING_ in *cryptsetup*(8) for more information.
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*WARNING:* --key-file option can be used only if there is only one active keyslot,
or alternatively, also if --key-slot option is specified (then all other keyslots
will be disabled in new LUKS device).
+
If this option is not used, cryptsetup will ask for all active keyslot
passphrases.
endif::[]
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_ERASE[]
*--key-file, -d* _name_ *(LUKS2 with HW OPAL only)*::

Read the Admin PIN or PSID (with --hw-opal-factory-reset) from file
depending on options used.
+
If the name given is "-", then the secret will be read from stdin.
In this case, reading will not stop at newline characters.
+

*--keyfile-size, -l* _value_::
Read a maximum of _value_ bytes from the key file. The default is to
read the whole file up to the compiled-in maximum that can be queried
with --help. Supplying more data than the compiled-in maximum aborts
the operation.
+
This option is useful to cut trailing newlines, for example. If
--keyfile-offset is also given, the size count starts after the offset.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_OPEN,ACTION_LUKSFORMAT,ACTION_REENCRYPT,ACTION_BENCHMARK,ACTION_LUKSADDKEY[]
*--key-size, -s* _bits_::
ifndef::ACTION_LUKSADDKEY,ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
Sets key size in _bits_. The argument has to be a multiple of 8. The
possible key-sizes are limited by the cipher and mode used.
+
See /proc/crypto for more information. Note that key-size in
/proc/crypto is stated in bytes.
+
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_LUKSADDKEY[]
Provide volume key size in _bits_. The argument has to be a multiple of 8.
+
This option is required when parameter --volume-key-file is used to provide
current volume key. Also, it is used when new unbound keyslot is created by
specifying --unbound parameter.
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_OPEN[]
This option can be used for _plain_ and _luks_ devices. For LUKS2 devices
in reencryption you may use the parameter twice to specify both old and new volume key
sizes. Each --key-size option corresponds to the respective --volume-key-file parameter
(also allowed to be used up to two times).
endif::[]
ifndef::ACTION_REENCRYPT,ACTION_OPEN,ACTION_LUKSADDKEY[]
This option can be used for _open --type plain_ or _luksFormat_. All
other LUKS actions will use the key-size specified in the LUKS header.
Use _cryptsetup --help_ to show the compiled-in defaults.
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*LUKS2*:
Provide current key size in _bits_. The argument has to be a multiple of 8.
Useful when specifying the size of current volume key when no keyslot is active.

*--key-slot, -S <0-N>*::
ifdef::ACTION_LUKSADDKEY[]
When used together with parameter --new-key-slot this option allows you to specify which
key slot is selected for unlocking volume key.
+
*NOTE:* This option is ignored if existing volume key gets unlocked
via LUKS2 token (--token-id, --token-type or --token-only parameters) or
when volume key is provided directly via --volume-key-file parameter.
+
*NOTE:* To maintain backward compatibility, without --new-key-slot parameter,
this option allows you to specify which key slot is selected for the new key.
endif::[]
ifndef::ACTION_OPEN,ACTION_LUKSADDKEY[]
For LUKS operations that add key material, this option allows you to
specify which key slot is selected for the new key.
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_OPEN[]
This option selects a specific key-slot to
compare the passphrase against. If the given passphrase would only
match a different key-slot, the operation fails.
endif::[]
+
ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
For reencryption mode it selects specific keyslot (and passphrase) that can be used to unlock new volume key.
If used all other keyslots get removed after reencryption operation is finished.
+
endif::[]
The maximum number of key slots depends on the LUKS version. LUKS1 can have up
to 8 key slots. LUKS2 can have up to 32 key slots based on key slot area
size and key size, but a valid key slot ID can always be between 0 and
31 for LUKS2.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_LUKSFORMAT,ACTION_LUKSADDKEY,ACTION_LUKSCHANGEKEY,ACTION_LUKSCONVERTKEY,ACTION_REENCRYPT[]

This option can be used to set specific key size for the LUKS2 keyslot
area.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_LUKSFORMAT,ACTION_CONFIG,ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*--label <LABEL> --subsystem <SUBSYSTEM>*::
Set label and subsystem description for LUKS2 device.
The label and subsystem are optional fields and can be later used
in udev scripts for triggering user actions once the device marked
by these labels is detected.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_OPEN,ACTION_LUKSRESUME[]
*--link-vk-to-keyring* _<keyring_description>::<key_description>_::
Link volume key in a keyring with specified key name. The volume key is linked only
if requested action is successfully finished (with --test-passphrase the verified
volume key is linked in a keyring without taking further action).
+
_<keyring_description>_ string has to contain existing kernel keyring
description. The keyring name may be optionally prefixed with "%:" or "%keyring:" type descriptions.
Or, the keyring may also be specified directly by numeric key id. Also special keyring notations
starting with "@" may be used to select existing predefined kernel keyrings.
+
The string "::" is delimiter used to separate keyring description and key description.
+
_<key_description>_ part describes key type and key name of volume key linked in the keyring
described in _<keyring_description>_. The type may be specified by adding "%<type_name>:" prefix in front of
key name. If type is missing default _user_ type is applied. If the key of same name and same type already exists (already linked in the keyring)
it will get replaced in the process.

*--new-key-size* _bits_::
Sets new key size in _bits_. The argument has to be a multiple of 8. The
possible key-sizes are limited by the new cipher and mode used in
reencryption.
+
See /proc/crypto for more information. Note that key-size in
/proc/crypto is stated in bytes.

*LUKS1*:
If you are increasing key size, there must be enough space in the LUKS header
for enlarged keyslots (data offset must be large enough) or reencryption
cannot be performed.

*NOTE:* When used this option affects --key-slot option.
+
The maximum number of key slots depends on the LUKS version. LUKS1 can have up
to 8 key slots. LUKS2 can have up to 32 key slots based on key slot area
size and key size, but a valid key slot ID can always be between 0 and
31 for LUKS2.

The size of key stored in a keyring must be compatible with new cipher used
in reencryption operation. See /proc/crypto for more information.
Note that key-size in /proc/crypto is stated in bytes.
+
The _<key description>_ uses keyctl-compatible syntax. This can either be a
numeric key ID or a string name in the format _%<key type>:<key name>_. See
also *KEY IDENTIFIERS* section of *keyctl*(1). When no _%<key type>:_ prefix
is specified we assume the key type is _user_ (default type).

ifdef::ACTION_LUKSFORMAT,ACTION_LUKSADDKEY,ACTION_LUKSCHANGEKEY,ACTION_LUKSCONVERTKEY,ACTION_REENCRYPT,ACTION_BENCHMARK[]
*--pbkdf <PBKDF spec>*::
Set Password-Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF) algorithm for LUKS
keyslot. The PBKDF can be: _pbkdf2_ (for PBKDF2 according to RFC2898),
_argon2i_ for Argon2i or _argon2id_ for Argon2id (see
https://www.cryptolux.org/index.php/Argon2[Argon2] for more info).
+
For LUKS1, only PBKDF2 is accepted (no need to use this option). The
default PBKDF for LUKS2 is set during compilation time and is available
in _cryptsetup --help_ output.
+
A PBKDF is used for increasing dictionary and brute-force attack cost
for keyslot passwords. The parameters can be time, memory and parallel
cost.
+
For PBKDF2, only time cost (number of iterations) applies. For
Argon2i/id, there is also memory cost (memory required during the
process of key derivation) and parallel cost (number of threads that run
in parallel during the key derivation.
+
Note that increasing memory cost also increases time, so the final
parameter values are measured by a benchmark. The benchmark tries to
find iteration time (_--iter-time_) with required memory cost
_--pbkdf-memory_. If it is not possible, the memory cost is decreased as
well. The parallel cost _--pbkdf-parallel_ is constant and is checked
against available CPU cores.
+
You can see all PBKDF parameters for particular LUKS2 keyslot with
*cryptsetup-luksDump*(8) command.
+
*NOTE:* If you do not want to use benchmark and want to specify all
parameters directly, use _--pbkdf-force-iterations_ with
_--pbkdf-memory_ and _--pbkdf-parallel_. This will override the values
without benchmarking. Note it can cause extremely long unlocking time
or cause out-of-memory conditions with unconditional process termination.
Use only in specific cases, for example, if you know that the formatted
device will be used on some small embedded system.
+
*MINIMAL AND MAXIMAL PBKDF COSTS:* For *PBKDF2*, the minimum iteration
count is 1000 and maximum is 4294967295 (maximum for 32bit unsigned
integer). Memory and parallel costs are unused for PBKDF2. For *Argon2i*
and *Argon2id*, minimum iteration count (CPU cost) is 4 and maximum is
4294967295 (maximum for 32bit unsigned integer). Minimum memory cost is
32 KiB and maximum is 4 GiB. (Limited by addressable memory on some CPU
platforms.) If the memory cost parameter is benchmarked (not specified
by a parameter) it is always in range from 64 MiB to 1 GiB. The parallel
cost minimum is 1 and maximum 4 (if enough CPUs cores are available,
otherwise it is decreased).

endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_OPEN[]
*--readonly, -r*::
set up a read-only mapping.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*--reduce-device-size* _size_::
This means that last _size_ sectors on the original device will be lost,
data will be effectively shifted by specified number of sectors.
+
It could be useful if you added some space to underlying partition or
logical volume (so last _size_ sectors contains no data).
+
For units suffix see --device-size parameter description.
+
*WARNING:* This is a destructive operation and cannot be reverted. Use
with extreme care - accidentally overwritten filesystems are usually
unrecoverable.
+
*LUKS2*:
Initialize LUKS2 reencryption with data device size reduction
(currently only encryption mode is supported).
+
Recommended minimal size is twice the default LUKS2 header size
(--reduce-device-size 32M) for encryption mode.

*LUKS1*:
Enlarge data offset to specified value by shrinking device size.

endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*--resilience* _mode_ *(LUKS2 only)*::
Reencryption resilience _mode_ can be one of _checksum_, _journal_ or
_none_.
+
_checksum_: default mode, where individual checksums of ciphertext
hotzone sectors are stored, so the recovery process can detect which
sectors were already reencrypted. It requires that the device sector
write is atomic.
+
_journal_: the hotzone is journaled in the binary area (so the data are
written twice).
+
_none_: performance mode. There is no protection and the only way it's
safe to interrupt the reencryption is similar to old offline
reencryption utility.
+
Resilience modes can be changed unless _datashift_ mode is used for
operation initialization (encryption with --reduce-device-size option)
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*--resilience-hash* _hash_ *(LUKS2 only)*::
The _hash_ algorithm used with "--resilience checksum" only. The default
hash is sha256. With other resilience modes, the hash parameter is
ignored.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*--resume-only (LUKS2 only)*::
Resume reencryption (any mode) operation already described in LUKS2
metadata. If no reencrypt operation is initialized, the command with
--resume-only parameter fails. Useful for resuming reencrypt operation
without accidentally triggering new reencryption operation.
endif::[]

ifndef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*--sector-size* _bytes_::
endif::[]
ifndef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
ifdef::ACTION_OPEN[]
Set encryption sector size for use with _plain_ device type. It must be power of two
and in range 512 - 4096 bytes. The default mode is 512 bytes.
+
Note that if sector size is higher than underlying device hardware
sector, using this option can increase risk on incomplete sector writes during a
power fail.
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_LUKSFORMAT[]
Set sector size for use with disk encryption. It must be power of two
and in range 512 - 4096 bytes. This option is available only with LUKS2
format.
+
For LUKS2 devices it's established based on parameters provided by
underlying data device. For native 4K block devices it's 4096 bytes.
For 4K/512e (4K physical sector size with 512 bytes emulation) it's
4096 bytes. For drives reporting only 512 bytes block size it remains
512 bytes. If data device is regular file put in filesystem it's 4096
bytes.
+
Note that if sector size is higher than underlying device hardware
sector and there is not integrity protection that uses data journal,
using this option can increase risk on incomplete sector writes during a
power fail.
+
If used together with _--integrity_ option and dm-integrity journal, the
atomicity of writes is guaranteed in all cases (but it cost write
performance - data has to be written twice).
endif::[]
+
Increasing sector size from 512 bytes to 4096 bytes can provide better
performance on most of the modern storage devices and also with some hw
encryption accelerators.
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*--sector-size* _bytes_ *(LUKS2 only)*::
Reencrypt device with new encryption sector size enforced.

run reencryption with --force-offline-reencrypt if unsure what block size
was filesystem formatted with.
endif::[]
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_OPEN[]
*--serialize-memory-hard-pbkdf*::
Use a global lock to serialize unlocking of keyslots using memory-hard
PBKDF.

*NOTE:* This is (ugly) workaround for a specific situation when multiple
devices are activated in parallel and system instead of reporting out of
memory starts unconditionally stop processes using out-of-memory killer.

*DO NOT USE* this switch until you are implementing boot environment
with parallel devices activation!

ifdef::ACTION_OPEN[]
*--skip, -p <number of 512 byte sectors>*::
Start offset used in IV calculation in 512-byte sectors (how many
sectors of the encrypted data to skip at the beginning). This option
is only relevant with plain or loopaes device types.
+
Hence, if --offset _n_, and --skip _s_, sector _n_ (the first sector of
the encrypted device) will get a sector number of _s_ for the IV
calculation.
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_OPEN,ACTION_TCRYPTDUMP[]
*--tcrypt-backup*::
*--tcrypt-hidden*::
*--tcrypt-system*::
Specify which TrueCrypt on-disk
header will be used to open the device. See _TCRYPT_ section in
*cryptsetup*(8) for more info.
+
Using a system-encrypted device with the *--tcrypt-system* option
requires specific settings to work as expected.
+
TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt supports full system encryption
(only a partition table is not encrypted) or system partition encryption
(only a system partition is encrypted).
The metadata header then contains the offset and size of the encrypted area.
Cryptsetup needs to know the specific partition offset to calculate
encryption parameters. To properly map a partition, you must specify
a real partition device so cryptsetup can calculate this offset.
+
While you can use a full device as a parameter (/dev/sdb), always prefer
to specify the partition you want to map (/dev/sdb1) as only system partition
mode can be detected this way.
+
For mapping images (stored in a file), you can use the additional
*--header* option with the real partition device.
If the *--header* is used (and it is different from the data image),
cryptsetup expects that the data image contains a snapshot of the data partition only.
+
If *--header* is not used (or points to the same image), cryptsetup expects that
the image contains a full disk (including the partition table).
This can map a full encrypted area not directly mountable as a filesystem.
Please prefer creating a loop device with partitions (*losetup -P*,
see *losetup(8)* man page) and use a real partition (/dev/loopXp1) as the device parameter.

*--timeout, -t <number of seconds>*::
The number of seconds to wait before timeout on passphrase input via

ifndef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
Use a volume key stored in a file.

ifdef::ACTION_FORMAT[]
+
This allows creating a LUKS header with this specific
volume key. If the volume key was taken from an existing LUKS header and
all other parameters are the same, then the new header decrypts the data
encrypted with the header the volume key was taken from. +
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_LUKSDUMP,ACTION_BITLKDUMP[]
The volume key is stored in a file instead of being printed out to standard output. +
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_LUKSADDKEY[]
This allows adding a new keyslot without having to know passphrase to existing one.
It may be also used when no keyslot is active.
+
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_OPEN[]
This allows one to open _luks_ and _bitlk_ device types without giving a passphrase. +
For devices in reencryption the option may be used twice to specify both old and new volume keys.
When using the option twice make sure you pair each --volume-key-file option with respective
--key-size parameter as well.
endif::[]
ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*LUKS2*:
Provides current volume key stored in a file. It can be used to reencrypt the device with
no active keyslot together with --new-volume-key-file or --new-volume-key-keyring options.
+
*LUKS1*:
See --new-volume-key-file.

ifdef::ACTION_LUKSFORMAT,ACTION_LUKSADDKEY[]
*WARNING:* If you create your own volume key, you need to make sure to
do it right. Otherwise, you can end up with a low-entropy or otherwise
partially predictable volume key which will compromise security.

ifdef::ACTION_OPEN,ACTION_RESIZE,ACTION_LUKSRESUME,ACTION_LUKSADDKEY[]
*--volume-key-keyring* _<key description>_::
Use a volume key stored in a keyring.
This allows one to open _luks_ and _plain_ device types without giving a passphrase.
+
For LUKS, the key and associated type has to be readable from userspace so that volume
key digest may be verified in before activation. For devices in reencryption the option may be
used twice to specify both old and new volume keys.
+
For PLAIN type, the user must ensure that the key in the keyring is unchanged since activation.
Otherwise, reloading the key can cause data corruption after an unexpected key change.

+
The _<key description>_ uses keyctl-compatible syntax. This can either be a
numeric key ID or a string name in the format _%<key type>:<key name>_. See
also *KEY IDENTIFIERS* section of *keyctl*(1). When no _%<key type>:_ prefix
is specified we assume the key type is _user_ (default type).
endif::[]

ifdef::ACTION_REENCRYPT[]
*--write-log (LUKS1 only)*::
Update log file after every block write. This can slow down reencryption
but will minimize data loss in the case of system crash.
