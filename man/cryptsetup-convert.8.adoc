== Name

cryptsetup-convert - converts the device between LUKS1 and LUKS2 format

== SYNOPSIS

*cryptsetup _convert_ --type <format> [<options>] <device>*

== DESCRIPTION

Converts the device between LUKS1 and LUKS2 format (if possible).
The conversion will not be performed if there is an additional LUKS2 feature or LUKS1 has unsupported header size.

For conversion from LUKS2 to LUKS1, all active keyslots must use the PBKDF2 key-derivation function.
The PBKDF2 and anti-forensic filter (AF) hash must be the same as the hash used in the digest.
All keyslot numbers must be lower than 8 (LUKS1 maximum slot number).
There must be at least one active keyslot and no unbound or reencryption keyslots.

Conversion (both directions) must be performed on inactive device.
There must not be active dm-crypt mapping established for LUKS header requested for conversion.

The *--type* option is mandatory with the following accepted values: _luks1_ or _luks2_.

*WARNING:* The _convert_ action can destroy the LUKS header in the case of a crash during conversion or if a media error occurs.
Always create a header backup before performing this operation!

*<options>* can be [--header, --type, --disable-locks].
