Example of simple dracut module for reencryption of system
LUKS drive on-the-fly.

Install in /usr/[share|lib]/dracut/modules.d/90reencrypt, then
build special intramfs "with dracut -a reencrypt -o crypt".
Reencrypt module doesn't work (has a conflict) with crypt module as
of now. After successfull reencryption reboot using original initramfs.

Dracut then recognize argument rd.luks.reencrypt=name:size,
e.g. rd.luks.reencrypt=sda2:52G means only 52G of device
will be reencrypted (default is whole device).
(Name is kernel name of device.)

Also, you may specify keyslot which you want to use for reencryption,
rd.luks.reencrypt_keyslot=<keyslot_number>. Bear in mind that if you
use this option, all other keyslots will be deactivated.

Another argument, rd.luks.reencrypt_key=/dev/sda:/path/to/keyfile
can be used to read password for specific keyslot from device containing
filesystem with a keyfile (file with a password). If you omit reencrypt_key
argument, reencryption would work only in case a LUKS container has
exactly one keyslot activated.

Arguments rd.luks.reencrypt_keyslot and rd.luks.reencrypt_key are not
mandatory.

Note that reencryption context is stored in ramdisk, any
fail can mean complete lost of data!
