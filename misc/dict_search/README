Simple example how to use libcryptsetup
for password search.

Run: crypt_dict luks|tcrypt <device|image> <dictionary> [cpus]

luks|tcrypt specified device type (LUKS or TrueCrypt)

<device|image> is LUKS or TrueCrypt device or image

<dictionary> is list of passphrases to try
(note trailing EOL is stripped)

cpus - number of processes to start in parallel

Format of dictionary file is simple one password per line,
if first char on line is # it is skipped as comment.

For LUKS, you have it run as root (device-mapper cannot
create dmcrypt devices as nrmal user. Code need
to map keyslots as temporary dmcrypt device.)

For TrueCrypt devices root privilege is not required.
